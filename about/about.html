        <p>I'm currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate through Coursera, where I'm gaining hands-on experience in network security, threat detection, and incident response. My coursework includes practical training in Python for security automation, Linux command-line tools, SQL for analyzing security data, and SIEM platforms for monitoring and mitigating threats.

For the past three years, I've worked in the youth residential care industry, where I've been responsible for ensuring client safety, maintaining strict confidentiality, writing detailed incident reports, and applying crisis prevention and intervention strategies. These responsibilities required strong situational awareness, calm decision-making under pressure, and a deep commitment to protecting othersâ€”skills that translate directly to cybersecurity work.

Now, I'm channeling that same dedication into securing digital systems and data.

I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow career changers, cybersecurity professionals, and tech enthusiasts who are passionate about safeguarding both people and information.
